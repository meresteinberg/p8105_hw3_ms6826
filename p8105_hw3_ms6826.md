## Problem 1

Loading Data

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

This dataset is very large (with over 2.5 million observations) because
it includes records from over 100,000 weather stations (with separate
observations for the same day from different stations) and includes
daily records of variables such as total precipitation, maximum and
minimum temperatures, total snowfall, etc. There is a lot of variability
in the data, as about half of the stations only report precipitation,
and each station covers varying periods of time. Since we have so many
observations for each day, I don’t think missing data will be a huge
issue once we can compile the observations for each day.

Data Cleaning

``` r
ny_noaa_clean=
ny_noaa |> 
  separate(
    date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-"
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    prcp= prcp/10
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    tmax= as.numeric(tmax, na.rm=TRUE),
    tmin= as.numeric(tmin, na.rm=TRUE)
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    tmax= tmax/10
  ) |> 
  mutate(tmin=tmin/10)
```

Separated date into 3 variables (year month day). Converted prcp to
units of mm so that snowfall, snow depth, and precipitation are all in
millimeters. Converted tmax and tmin to units of Celcius.

``` r
ny_noaa_clean |> 
  count(snow) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  head()
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 2
    ##    snow       n
    ##   <int>   <int>
    ## 1     0 2008508
    ## 2    NA  381221
    ## 3    25   31022
    ## 4    13   23095
    ## 5    51   18274
    ## 6    76   10173

The most commonly observed values for snowfall is 0 mm. This may be
because this data is collected station information from over 180
countries and territories, and these places may be in climates that do
not often have snow.

Making a two-panel plot

``` r
station_avgtmax=
ny_noaa_clean |> 
   filter(month %in% c("01", "07")) |> 
  group_by(id, year, month) |> 
  summarize(mean_tmax= mean(tmax, na.rm=TRUE)) |> 
  drop_na(mean_tmax)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'id', 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
ggplot_avgtmax=
  station_avgtmax |> 
 ggplot(aes(x=year, y=mean_tmax, group=id)) +
  geom_point()  +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  facet_grid(. ~ month)

ggplot_avgtmax
```

![](p8105_hw3_ms6826_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- --> The
mean max temperature for the stations in January (winter weather) are on
average ~25 degrees Celcius lower than the mean max temperatures in July
(summer weather). The graph also indicates that there is more variation
in temperature in January (points are more spread out) compared to July.
There are a few outliers for each month that are below the general mean
temperature for that year, and the most significant outlier is for a
station in July in the year 1988.

Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
(note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make a
plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less
than 100 separately by year.

``` r
station_tmax_tmin=
  ny_noaa_clean |> 
  drop_na(tmax) |> 
  drop_na(tmin)

ggp_tmax_tmin=
station_tmax_tmin |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=tmin, y=tmax)) +
  geom_hex()

station_snow=
  ny_noaa_clean |> 
  filter(snow>0, snow<100)

ggp_snow=
  station_snow |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=snow, y=as.factor(year))) +
  geom_density_ridges()

(ggp_tmax_tmin + ggp_snow)
```

## Problem 2

Load, tidy, merge, and organize the data sets

``` r
covar_df=
  read_csv("data/nhanes_covar.csv", skip=4, na= c("NA")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    sex= case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      2 ~ "female"
    )) |> 
  mutate(
    education=case_match(
      education,
      1 ~ "less_than_high_school",
      2 ~ "high_school_equivalent",
      3 ~ "more_than_high_school"
    )
  )
```

  mutate(education= factor(education, levels= c("less_than_high_school", "high_school_equivalent", "more_than_high_school" ) )) |> 
  drop_na(bmi, education)
```

Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each
education category, and create a visualization of the age distributions
for men and women in each education category.

``` r
mims_df |> 
  group_by(sex, education) |>

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

| less_than_high_school  |     28 |   27 |
| high_school_equivalent |     23 |   35 |

   labs(title = "Age Distribution by Education Level and Sex",
       x = "Education Level",
       y = "Age") +
  theme_minimal()

![](p8105_hw3_ms6826_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- --> The
reader friendly table tells us that most of the men and women have an
education level greater than high school level. The lowest frequency of

women) for those with above high school education is lower (~45 years)
than the median age for education levels at or below high school level.

Create a total activity variable and plot against age.

Activity level during daylight hours seems to be slightly higher among
people with more than a high school education compared to people with
high school equivalent or less than. Additionally, it seems like there
are no major differences between male and female activity levels for any
education level, except with females being slightly more active than
males for those who have higher than high school-level education.

The combined dataset of 1% of citibike rides \<4 hours from July2020,
July2024, Jan2020, and Jan2024 includes two new rows that indicate the
“month” and “year” the ride comes from. The dataset includes information
like the type of bike (aka variable ‘rideable_type’) whcih could be
classic or electric, as well as the duration of the ride in minutes.

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year', 'month'. You can override using the

| 2024 | jan   |   2108 |  16753 |
| 2024 | july  |  10894 |  36262 |

Citi Bike members have significantly more rides for each month/year. For
both members and casual riders, the number of rides increases from
January to July in 2020 and 2024, which makes sense due to nicer weather
in July.

Median duration of bikerides was higher in 2020 for all weekdays and
both months, and they are especially higher in July 2020 vs 2024 (maybe
because of pandemic in July 2020). Also, it makes sense that for both
2020 and 2024, almost all median July bikeride durations are greater
compared to January, because it is during the summer.

For data in 2024, make a figure that shows the impact of month,
membership status, and bike type on the distribution of ride duration.

``` r

  mutate(year== "2024") |>

Based on the graph of 2024 data, it appears that median bike ride
duration is slightly longer for casual (non-member) Citi Bikers in both
July and January. Additionally, it is apparent that the duration of bike
rides is longer in July compared to January. And there doesn’t seem to
be any significant differences in classic bike vs electric bike duration
in January or July by members/casual riders. The only difference of note
would be that there are slightly longer rides for classic bikes compared
to electric bikes among casual riders.
